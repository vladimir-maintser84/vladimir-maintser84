# 👋  Hi there! 

## About me

My name is Vladimir Maintser, I am currently learning Software Development.
I'm actively exploring both Frontend and Backend development, as I'm still figuring out which path excites me more. Right now, I'm focusing on Java Core and building small projects to sharpen my skills.


## My goals:
- ✅ Strengthen my programming skills
- 🚀 Build large, meaningful projects
- 👨‍💻 Land a developer job in the near future
-----------------

In my free time, I enjoy:

- 🎮 Playing video games
- 🍵 Practicing the tea ceremony


I can communicate in English, Russian, and German.
